# The Rust half of `pnpm run verify`, and the same phases CI's `rust` job runs.
#
# Runs LAST in `verify`, after `vp test`, per issue #219 - on the reasoning that
# a cold cargo build should not sit in front of the phases that fail fastest.
# That premise was re-measured on 2026-09-05 and the numbers below replace an
# earlier header claiming "1.62s cold, 0.84s warm" - wrong by more than a
# hundredfold, and impossible for a script that runs the crate's tests twice.
# Warm, each phase timed on its own: `cargo test --locked -p fmw-noise
# --features poison` 82.4s, `cargo test --locked --workspace` 26.0s, the
# wasm32 release build 2.8s, `cargo deny check` 0.6s, fmt + clippy 0.3s.
# That is 112.0s, which is 54% of `pnpm run verify` and its LARGEST phase.
# The `cargo doc` phase added in #388 does not move that total: 0.03s warm and
# 0.7s cold, because `--no-deps` rustdoc on a zero-dependency crate compiles
# nothing at all.
#
# The poison phase's cost is the poison, not the test count: filtering to
# `fixtures::` runs 108 tests instead of 452 and still costs 81.3s, and those
# same 108 tests cost 20.8s clean against 81.2s poisoned. Perturbing every op
# drives the code into much slower paths. Narrowing this phase was measured
# and buys nothing; whether the 3.9x itself is inherent is NOT measured.
#
# The cost that IS real is the FIRST run on a machine with no Rust: rustup
# installs the pinned toolchain and its components before anything here runs.
# `pnpm run verify` now needs a cargo, which it did not before.

# links through a fully green gate in #387: deleting a documented item left the
# module doc above it linking to a function that no longer existed. See #388.
#
# `--document-private-items` is load-bearing rather than thorough. Without it
# rustdoc only checks links on PUBLIC items, and 2 of the 11 broken links this
# phase was added to clear were invisible to that view - both in
# `cliffs/catalog.rs`, on private items. The public view is the weaker net, and
# this crate is `publish = false` with mostly private internals anyway.
#
# That is a planted result, not a reading of the flag's docs: re-breaking the
# link on `cliffs/catalog.rs:379` - a doc on a PRIVATE item - leaves the public
# view exiting 0, having missed it, while this command exits 101.

# hook, and because every ported op composed it, one hook reddened everything.
# The five primitives added in that batch compose it in NONE of their paths, so

#
# Adding an op therefore means adding its tier-1 test here. A list rather than a

#
# Entries are FULL test paths, not bare names. That changed with #224, and the

# test's control could not stand in for, and the only test that can see it is a
# unit test living beside the op in `tiles::fulgora_catalog`. Requiring every
# entry to sit in `fixtures::` would have meant either moving that test away
# from its op or leaving the argmax with no control of its own.

  # boxes read `moisture` and `temperature`, all of which already carry theirs.
  #
  # The third test here is the one worth naming. It scores both fixtures WITHOUT
  # the capture-grid snap, so it is the control on the snap rather than on the
  # port - and it is still listed, because a perturbation has to move it too. A
  # test that stayed green under poison while its snapped twin went red would

  # all of which carry theirs, and the last of those already covers the discrete
  # half - which spots survive the trim.
  #
  # Both listed tests were watched going red rather than assumed to. The second
  # is worth naming because its control is THIN: it counts positions where the
  # clamped probability is positive, and `probability` is 0 at 990 of 1032
  # positions, so a perturbation has to push one across zero to be seen. It
  # does - 42 becomes 43 at seed 123456 - but that is one position, so do not

  #
  #   - `poison::f64_result` on `cliffiness_basic`, the only numeric field;
  #   - `poison::crossing_result` on `crosses_cliff`, whose output is a
  #     TRI-STATE classification a numeric hook cannot reach;
  #   - `poison::sweep_order` on `fixImpossibleCells`, which has no value to
  #     bend at all - only a choice of which edge to clear;
  #   - `poison::bool_result` on `isCliffConnected` and the ore rejection.
  #

  #
  # Neither test reads a game fixture, and that is deliberate rather than a

  # region costs ~33s in a debug build - the same order as the cliff connection
  # test that already took this script to 1m50s. The roll is graded against

  # `expressions::fulgora_scrap`, which `fixtures::reproduces_the_fulgora_scrap_
  # probability_at_every_captured_position` already grades.
  #
  # Watched going red rather than assumed to: the perturbation inverts every
  # accept, so the window's placements go from 177 to 16,207 of 16,384 and the
  # test's upper bound trips.
  #
  # Its sibling `the_collision_box_cannot_reject_anything` is deliberately
  # ABSENT. That one compares a poisoned arm against a poisoned arm, so the
  # perturbation cancels and it stays green - the relational shape `poison.rs`

  # is worth knowing before anyone adds a second like it. Measured: 33s in the
  # normal arm and 93s under poison, which took this whole script from a few
  # seconds to **1m50s** wall. Poisoning is the expensive half because
  # `crossing_result` turns every lattice edge into a crossing, so far more
  # cells place and the onDestroy cascade recurses over a dense set.
  #
  # `verify:rust` is therefore NO LONGER the cheapest job in the workflow. It is
