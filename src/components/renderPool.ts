/**
 * Concurrency for the region-tiled renderer: plan a render into tiles, keep at
 * most `size` of them in flight, and hand each finished tile to `onTile` so the
 * caller can paint it immediately.
 *
 * `execute` is the seam. In the app it posts to one of `size` Web Workers (the
 * `slot` argument says which); in tests it calls `runRenderRequest` in-process,
 * which is what lets the tiled-equals-untiled gate run in Node with no Workers.
