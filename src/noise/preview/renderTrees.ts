/**
 * Composite the tree overlay onto a terrain ImageData: sweep the same pixel grid
 * as renderTerrain and blend the game's tree chart color over each pixel with an
 * alpha proportional to the pixel's tree-footprint coverage. Mutates `base` in
 * place.
 *
 * Why a footprint kernel and not a flat per-pixel blend: the game's own map
 * preview places real tree entities and charts each one via
 * `ChartingInterface::drawRectangle`, which rasterizes an entity's box
 * floor-to-ceil and blends every pixel it touches at full alpha (see
 * `0x1001b1fdc` in the disassembly). A tree's charted box is 1.0x1.0 tiles, so
 * with a uniformly distributed sub-tile placement it paints its own tile's
 * pixel with probability 1, each of the 4 edge-adjacent pixels with probability
 * 0.5, and each diagonal with probability 0.25 - the separable kernel
 * `[0.5, 1.0, 0.5]`. We cannot place individual trees without the per-chunk
 * placement roll (deferred - see docs/noise/placement-roll-NOTES.md), so we
 * draw the EXPECTED coverage instead: the density is exactly the probability
 * the game rolls against, because arbitration picks the max-probability entity
 * per tile and rolls once. Treating neighbouring tiles' placements as
 * independent events, the probability at least one paints a given pixel is one
 * minus the product of all their misses - which also self-limits at 1 with no
 * artificial clamp needed. Modelling one pixel per tree left the overlay 4.2x
 * under-inked against a real game render; this closes that gap. See the design
 * spec for the full RE and the coverage-prediction validation against seed
 * 123456 (9.80% / 11.46% / 13.13% predicted for box sizes 0.8 / 1.0 / 1.2
 * against a measured 11.49%).
 *
 * Trees do not place on water, so water pixels are skipped, reusing renderTerrain's
 * exact water decision via WATER_TILE_COLORS the same way renderResources does.
 * Cliff exclusion is not wired, matching the existing deferred ore-on-cliffs item.
 *
 * The blend itself compounds per drawn tree, not per coverage probability:
 * `drawRectangle` blends the tree color into the chart once for every tree
 * that touches a pixel, so two overlapping trees reach
 * `1 - (1 - TREE_MAX_ALPHA)^2`, not a single capped blend at `TREE_MAX_ALPHA`.
 * Blending once against a coverage probability structurally capped alpha at
 * `TREE_MAX_ALPHA` (0.398) and left the overlay under-inked (3.85 vs. the
 * game's 5.70 total ink units at seed 123456, whose implied alpha reaches a
 * measured max of 0.952). Moving the per-tree alpha inside the product lets
 * independent blends compound instead.
