//! The two cliff fields for Vulcanus, ported from
//! `src/noise/cliffs/vulcanusCliffFields.ts`.
//!
//! Vulcanus does not reuse Nauvis's cliff expressions. `planet-map-gen.lua:13`
//! overrides both properties:
//!
//! ```lua
//! cliffiness      = "cliffiness_basic",
//! cliff_elevation = "cliff_elevation_from_elevation",   -- = "elevation"
//! cliff_settings  = { name = "cliff-vulcanus",
//!                     cliff_elevation_interval = 120,
//!                     cliff_elevation_0 = 70 }
//! ```
//!
//! so this port is much smaller than the Nauvis one will be: `cliff_elevation`
//! is the planet's own elevation, and `cliffiness_basic` is a single clamp over
//! a 2-octave `quick_multioctave_noise`. None of the Nauvis hills / ringbreak /
//! billows machinery is involved.
//!
//! **There are no Vulcanus cliff sliders.**
//! `space-age/prototypes/autoplace-controls.lua` defines `gleba_cliff` and
//! `fulgora_cliff` but no Vulcanus equivalent, and the planet's
//! `autoplace_controls` list has no cliff entry - so frequency and continuity
//! are fixed at 1 and `cliff_richness` is fixed at 1. The interval and
//! elevation-0 below are planet constants for the same reason: they come from
//! the planet definition, not from the user's preset, which describes a Nauvis
//! surface.
