//! `Cliff::updateConnections` and `Cliff::onDestroy` - the APPLY-time pass that
//! trims a cliff run back to where its connections actually resolve.
//!
//! Ported from `src/noise/cliffs/cliffConnections.ts`. Where
//! [`super::placement`] models `crossingsForChunk` and `generateCliffs` -
//! deciding the crossings and queueing a cliff per placing cell - this models
//! what happens **after** that, in `EntityMapGenerationTask::applyCliffs`:
//!
//! ```text
//! for each queued CliffAddition {u16 protoId, u8 orientation, MapPosition, bool}:
//!     collided = Surface::wouldCollide(proto, position, orientation)
//!     entity   = proto->createEntity(spec)
//!     addEntityToSurface(surface, entity)
//!     if (collided)          -> list A
//!     else if (!record.bool) -> list B          // record.bool is !onChunkBorder
//! for e in list A: e->forceDestroy()
//! for e in list B: e->updateConnections()
//! ```
//!
//! Two things follow that are easy to miss:
//!
//! **The fifth argument of `tryToAddCliff` is what selects list B.**
//! `generateCliffs` computes `onChunkBorder = (cx==0 || cy==0 || cx==7 ||
//! cy==7)` over the chunk's 8x8 cells and passes `!onChunkBorder`; `applyCliffs`
//! skips `updateConnections` when that byte is set. So this whole pass runs on
//! the chunk's outer ring and nowhere else. An earlier note read the flag as
//! "measured not to matter for placement" - true of `tryToAddCliff`, which
//! stores it and never reads it, and false of the queue's consumer.
//!
//! **List B is drained after the whole chunk is on the surface**, so within a
//! chunk there is no placement-order dependence.
//!
//! ## The orientation is read twice, and that is the whole reason a cell can
//! lose two ends in one pass
//!
//! `Cliff::updateConnections` reads the orientation it ITERATES once, before
//! the loop, and re-reads the one it COMPARES from `this+0x80` inside it. So a
//! `destroyEnd` earlier in the loop is visible to the sides after it. This port
//! does the same, and `tests::a_cell_can_lose_both_ends_in_one_pass` is what
//! keeps that from silently collapsing into a snapshot.
//!
//! ## The `this+0x83` gate is `proto->place_as_crater == nullptr`
//!
//! The constructor computes it in one instruction on `proto + 0xb90`, and
//! `CliffPrototype` has exactly one optional pointer-valued property. The same
//! byte gates `getNeighbor`, `destroyEnd`, `onDestroy`'s cascade, `connectEnd`
//! and `getConnections`. So `cliff-vulcanus` runs all of it and
//! **`crater-cliff` runs none of it** - craters are outside the connection
//! system entirely, which is worth knowing before attributing anything
//! crater-shaped to these rules.
//!
//! ## What is NOT on the render path
//!
//! Nothing in the shipped Vulcanus cliff overlay calls this. It is the model
//! #84's investigation is scored with, and it is ported so that investigation
//! can run against the engine rather than only against the TypeScript. Read
//! [`apply_cliff_connections`]'s own note on the halo before using it for
//! anything else.
