//! Cliff catalog: the engine-level tables the placement pass keys on, ported
//! from `src/noise/cliffs/cliffCatalog.ts`.
//!
//! Most of it is `CliffGenerator` / `CellCliffCrossing` behaviour rather than
//! planet behaviour, so it is shared by every planet that places cliffs.
//! Vulcanus has no cliff autoplace control at all.
//!
//! Part of the Nauvis lever math that shares the TypeScript file arrived with
//! #226 and lives here too: [`modified_elevation_interval`] and
//! [`modified_richness`]. The slider narrowing does NOT, and the round trip is
//! worth reading twice. This module doc once said that block was deliberately
//! absent because "`slider_to_linear` already lives in [`crate::eval::math`]";
//! #226 judged that reasoning wrong and added a local f64 copy beside these
//! two. #324 then asked the game, and the ORIGINAL reasoning was right - the
//! copy scored 5 of 39 and is deleted. See the comment where it used to sit.
//!
//! ## What was read out of the binary, and where
//!
//! The TypeScript file carries the full disassembly recipe and the addresses;
//! this repeats only what a reader needs to judge the tables:
//!
//! - [`CLIFF_PLACING_CODES`] and [`CLIFF_CODE_TO_ORIENTATION`] are the low and
//!   high halves of the one 64-bit word `CellCliffCrossing::toMaybeCliffOrienta
//!   tion` returns. The mapping is a BIJECTION - 20 codes onto 20 orientations,
//!   none used twice and none unused - and [`tests::the_code_to_orientation_map
//!   _is_a_bijection`] asserts that rather than trusting it.
//! - [`CLIFF_ORIENTATION_NAMES`] came from `CliffOrientationName::buildMapping`,
//!   which registers name/value pairs in ascending value order, so the index
//!   into that array IS the id the engine uses. The connection tables in
//!   [`super::connections`] are derived from these names, which is what makes a
//!   transcription slip fail rather than shift the model.
//! - [`CLIFF_ORIENTATION_COLLISION_BOX`] is the table the engine loads into
//!   `proto + 0x5c0 + id * 0x48`, and `tryToAddCliff` hands it to `wouldCollide`
//!   with `Direction = 0` - the identity arm, which copies the rectangle
//!   verbatim and discards `rotbb`'s `1/8` orientation tag. So the collision
//!   shape is the RAW stored rectangle, not a rotated one.
//!
//! ## The boxes are literals here and computed in the TypeScript
//!
//! The TypeScript builds this table at module load by calling `rotbbBox`. This
//! port ships the 20 rectangles as constants and keeps [`rotbb_box`] live
//! beside them, with `tests::the_rotbb_derivation_reproduces_every_shipped_box`
//! asserting the two agree bit-for-bit.
//!
//! That is strictly stronger than either half alone, and it is not a style
//! choice: every edge is an exact multiple of `1/256`, because `MapPosition` is
//! 8-bit fixed point and `rotbb`'s `sqrt(2)` cannot survive into the engine at
//! full precision. Shipping the quantised values means the render path does no
//! floating-point rounding for the boxes at all, while the derivation stays
//! checkable against the Lua it came from.
