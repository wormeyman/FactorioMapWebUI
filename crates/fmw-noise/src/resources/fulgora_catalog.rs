//! Fulgora's one resource: scrap, and the roll that turns its probability into
//! placed entities.
//!
//! Ported from `src/noise/resources/fulgoraResourceCatalog.ts`.
//!
//! **There is no `threshold` mode here and no `region` function**, unlike the
//! Nauvis and Vulcanus catalogs, because scrap does not use
//! `resource_autoplace_all_patches`. Its autoplace is a bare
//! `probability_expression` + `richness_expression` pair, and
//! `expressions::fulgora_scrap` caps the probability at 0.5 with the Lua's own
//! `min`, so it never saturates into a patch. It ROLLS.
//!
//! ## This is NOT the scrap footprint
//!
//! `fmw-wasm`'s `VIEW_SCRAP_FOOTPRINT` paints every tile where
//! `probability > 0`. This module paints the subset a random draw accepts,
//! which is the smaller set the app's `"all"` composite draws. The two answer
//! different questions and the footprint view's own doc comment explains why it
//! is deliberately not this: diffing rolled pixels against the game's drawn
//! pixels measures the salt rather than the model.
//!
//! **The gap is large enough to see.** Measured 2026-08-31 by
//! `places_a_strict_nonempty_subset_of_the_footprint`, over a 128x128 window
//! at the origin, seed 123456, neutral sliders: 708 of 16,384 tiles are in the
//! footprint and 177 of those are placed, so the roll accepts 25.0% of it.
//! Substituting one view for the other would move 531 pixels in that window.
//!
//! ## The collision box is carried and is inert
//!
//! Passing an inert gate looks like an oversight, so it is stated here and
//! asserted in this module's own test rather than left to be rediscovered. The
//! TypeScript passes it for the same reason, and
//! `test/fulgoraScrapDensity.spec.ts` makes the same assertion on that side.
