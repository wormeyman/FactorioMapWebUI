//! Vulcanus's resource region fields, ported from
//! `src/noise/expressions/vulcanusResources.ts`.
//!
//! Transcribed from `space-age/prototypes/planet/planet-vulcanus-map-gen.lua`
//! lines ~560-862. Two consumers read this layer, which is why it lives in
//! `expressions/` rather than beside a renderer: the tile argmax reads
//! `vulcanus_metal_tile`, `vulcanus_calcite_region` and
//! `vulcanus_sulfuric_acid_region_patchy` inside four `*_range` expressions, and
//! the resource overlay reads the four regions directly.
//!
//! ## Two approximations carried over verbatim from the TypeScript
//!
//! 1. `random_penalty_between(0.9, 1, 1)` is taken as `1`. It appears in every
//!    `*_probability` expression. `random_penalty` is a batch op whose value
//!    depends on the whole batch and its order, so a per-pixel renderer cannot
//!    reproduce it; at `rp = 1` the probability collapses to `1000 * region`,
//!    and the penalty only perturbs the razor edge of a patch.
//! 2. Richness is not ported at all - the preview renders placement, not yield.
//!
//! Both are reproduced rather than fixed, so tier 2 stays a statement about the
//! port and not about a unilateral improvement. That is the same rule #269,
//! #273 and #279 were found under.
//!
//! ## The region cache is real state, like the biome layer's and unlike the rest
//!
//! Every other read in this layer is at the same `(x, y)`, so the TypeScript's
//! `memoXY` wrappers need no counterpart - the chain evaluates top to bottom
//! into locals and that is what a same-position memo achieves, bit-identically.
//!
//! The four spot fields are the exception. A query at `(x, y)` reads selected
//! spots from every region within `MAX_SPOT_BASEMENT_RADIUS`, which is genuine
//! cross-position state, so it is a `RefCell<BTreeMap>` keyed by `(seed1,
//! region_x, region_y)`. One map rather than four, because `seed1` already
//! separates the four streams and a second container could only drift from it.
//!
//! `BTreeMap` rather than `HashMap` for the reason `vulcanus_biomes` records:
//! nothing iterates it today, but a determinism-critical port should not carry
//! a container whose iteration order is unspecified.
//!
//! ## Cost
//!
//! `select_spots` evaluates density and favorability at accepted candidates,
//! and both pull a whole biome-full chain at that candidate. The TypeScript
//! memoizes those; this recomputes them.
//!
//! **This layer IS on a render path now, and the recomputation was measured
//! rather than left as a caveat.** The ore -> cliff rejection reaches it through
//! [`VulcanusResources::ore_regions`], so the `cliffs` view evaluates this
//! chain a couple of tiles per placed cell. This comment used to say "nothing
//! on the render path reaches this layer yet, so it is correct-first by choice",
//! and its own next sentence said what to do when that stopped being true.
//!
//! Measured at 256x256, 1 tile/px, seed 123456, min of 5 after a warm pass,
//! three separate runs agreeing to the second decimal - as the cost of the
//! cliff OVERLAY relative to the terrain sweep in the SAME arm:
//!
//! | arm | terrain | cliffs | overlay |
//! | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
//! | TypeScript | 33.10 us/px | 42.41 us/px | 1.28x |
//! | WASM | 8.64 us/px | 9.52 us/px | **1.10x** |
//!
//! So the un-memoized chain costs proportionally LESS here than the memoized
//! one does in the TypeScript. The reason is that the cliff pass is not
//! per-pixel: it walks a 4-tile lattice and touches two tiles per placed cell,
//! so this layer is evaluated a few thousand times against the terrain sweep's
//! 65,536. A memo would be optimising something that is already 10% of the
//! render.
//!
//! **Read the RATIOS, not the microseconds.** Those absolutes are from a run
//! inside vitest, where the TypeScript arm pays #267's per-module transform and
//! the WASM arm does not - `docs/noise/vulcanus-cliffs-NOTES.md` measures the
//! same TypeScript terrain view at 12.68 us/px outside it. A ratio between the
//! two arms would be measuring the harness; a ratio WITHIN one arm cancels it,
//! which is the only reading this table supports.
//!
//! `multioctave_noise`'s docs record what happened the last time a per-call
//! rebuild went unmeasured, which was 20x - that is why this was measured, and
//! the answer this time is that it does not matter.
