//! Factorio's `voronoi_*` noise primitives - all four ops, for any `jitter` in
//! `[0, 1]`. Ported from `src/noise/voronoiNoise.ts`.
//!
//! **Full RE record: `docs/noise/voronoi-NOTES.md`** - the disassembly
//! addresses, the models that were tried and refuted, and the method behind
//! every number quoted here. This file carries the findings at their sites.
//!
//! Validated bit-exact at f32 against the real 2.1.12 binary:
//! `oracle-voronoi-jitter0.seed123456.json` (15 series x 175 positions at
//! jitter 0), `oracle-voronoi-points.seed123456.json` (45 series x 175, plus an
//! inversion lattice of 6 x 4096 that recovers the point positions themselves),
//! `oracle-voronoi-cellid.multiseed.json` (9 seed series x 256 cells) and
//! `oracle-voronoi-search-range.seed123456.json`.
//!
//! **The jitter-0 rung is DEGENERATE.** At jitter 0 every cell is a congruent
//! unit square, so many different algorithms collapse onto identical numbers -
//! reproducing it is no evidence at all about jitter > 0. Two findings came out
//! of actually testing the jittered rung, and both are recorded at their sites:
//! the sample-to-point delta has to be rebased on the sample's own cell (see
//! [`Voronoi::delta_to`]), and the pyramid's jitter-0 formula was simply wrong once the
//! cells are not squares (0 of 175 at every jitter x distance_type).
//!
//! Three properties of this file are measurements rather than readings, and
//! each would be easy to get plausibly wrong:
//!
//! 1. **Everything is computed in GRID UNITS.** The docs read like "compute the
//!    distance in tiles, then divide by grid_size". The two are algebraically
//!    identical and differ only in f32 rounding, and three of the four distance
//!    types cannot tell them apart. `minkowski3` can: dividing at the end scores
//!    110/175 where dividing the deltas first scores 175/175, because its cube
//!    root runs through fastapprox and amplifies the difference past one ULP.
//! 2. **`minkowski3` uses the game's fastapprox `log2`/`exp2` pair, not a real
//!    cube root.** An exact cube root scores 25/175.
//! 3. **`voronoi_pyramid_noise` differs per distance type, and chebyshev is the
//!    odd one out** - by one hardcoded `0.75` where an isometry wants
//!    `1/sqrt(2)`. See [`CHEBYSHEV_FRAME`].
