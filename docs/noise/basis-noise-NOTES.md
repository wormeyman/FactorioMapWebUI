# basis_noise - reverse-engineering notes

Source: Factorio 2.1.11 (build 86962), captured headless via probe
`noise-expression` prototypes read back with `LuaSurface.calculate_tile_properties`,
and cross-checked against a disassembly of the shipped executable (the Mach-O
retains its C++ symbols). Reference implementation: `src/noise/basisNoise.ts`.
Fixtures: `test/fixtures/basis-noise.seed123456.json` (field) and
`test/fixtures/basis-noise-seeding.game.json` (seed -> field). Tests:
`test/basisNoise.spec.ts`, `test/basisNoiseSeeding.spec.ts`.

## The result

```
basis_noise(x, y) = SUM over the 4 cell corners of  (1 - d)^3 * (D . G[h(i,j)])

  D          = (x, y) - corner        (in noise space: world coords * input_scale)
  d          = |D|^2                  (corners with d >= 1 contribute nothing)
  G[h]       = 4.2 * (cos(2*pi*h/256), sin(2*pi*h/256))
  h(i, j)    = a[i & 255] XOR b[j & 255]
  a, b       = per-axis permutations of 0..255
```

Reproduces the game to **max error 3.1e-7** over 512 independent points, at a
different `input_scale` than the tables were measured at. For scale: the game's
own `multioctave_noise{octaves=1}` and `basis_noise` disagree by ~2e-6 (its `pow`
is documented as coming from the fastapprox library), so this is a closer match
than Factorio is to itself.

The tables `a`, `b` and the gradient assignment are now derived **straight from
the seed** (`basisNoiseTablesFromSeed`); see "The seeding" below.

## Why this shape

[FFF-112](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-112) (2015) says: *"Our noise will
have the simple square grid from Perlin noise, the gradient summation idea from
simplex noise and a very cool hash function from 'Better Gradient Noise'."*

All three checked out, 11 years and two noise-system rewrites later:

- **Square grid from Perlin** - integer lattice, 4 corners per cell.
- **Gradient summation from simplex** - contributions are *summed* with a radial
  falloff, not separably interpolated. `(1-d)^3` reaches exactly 0 at `d = 1`,
  which is why integer lattice points return exactly 0 (the documented quirk
  falls out of the kernel; it is not special-cased).
- **Hash from Better Gradient Noise** - Kensler, Knoll & Shirley, SCI Technical
  Report UUSCI-2008-001. The FFF's link is dead; live copy at
  <http://eastfarthing.com/publications/noise.pdf>. Its Section 2 replaces
  Perlin's nested `P[P[i]+j]` with a separate permutation table per dimension,
  XORed: `H_ij = Px[i] ^ Py[j]`, for axial decorrelation.

Note FFF-112 says Wube took **only the hash**, not BGN's 4x4 reconstruction
kernel - and that is measurable: the full BGN kernel gives 0.212 at integer
lattice points where the game gives exactly 0.

## Evidence

| claim | test | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| kernel is `(1-d)^3` | predict 3000 points using *measured* gradients | max err 3.5e-6; `(1-d)^2/^4/^5` all fail by ~1e0 |
| hash is `a[i] ^ b[j]` | collision `G(i1,j1)=G(i2,j2)` must force `G(i1,j2)=G(i2,j1)` | 162812 pairs, **0 violations** |
| hash group is `(Z/2)^8` | row permutations generate a group | order exactly 256, exactly 8 generators |
| gradient magnitude | direct measurement, 9216 lattice points | 4.19999919 +/- 1.4e-6 |
| 256 uniform directions | angle spacing | exactly 360/256 = 1.40625 deg, std 0.0000 |
| period 256 per axis | `G(k)` vs `G(k+256)` | 0.000e+00 (exact) |
| full model | 512 independent points from tables alone | max err 3.1e-7, corr 1.0000000000 |
| seed -> tables | 9 seed pairs generated from seed alone vs the game | max err 2.8e-7 |

## The probing technique

The trick that made this tractable: **near a lattice point every other corner's
falloff vanishes**, so

```
value(c + eps*u) = eps * (u . G[c])   + O(eps^3)
```

which reads gradients straight out of the game, one lattice point at a time. It
works for *any* candidate falloff, since every candidate has `falloff(0) = 1` -
so gradients can be measured **before** knowing the kernel, and the kernel then
solved with gradients held fixed. Two unknowns, separated.

Three traps, all of which cost a run:

- **`MapPosition` is 1/256 fixed-point** (the same fixed-point
  `src/codec/mapExchangeString.ts` decodes for `starting_points`). A world offset
  below 1/256 rounds to zero. An `eps` of 0.001 therefore lands exactly *on* the
  lattice and returns all zeros - which looks like a broken probe but is the game
  being precise. Choose `eps` via `input_scale`: one world tile = `input_scale`
  noise units.
- **Use power-of-two `input_scale`.** Noise coords must be exact in f32. Large
  world coords with a tiny `eps` cause catastrophic cancellation - at
  `input_scale = 1e-3` this inflated the noise floor ~1000x and made distinct
  gradients look continuous.
- **`calculate_tile_properties(property_names, positions)`** - property names
  come first. The HTML docs and `runtime-api.json` list `positions` first, but the
  `order` field (property_names=0) is authoritative.

## The seeding - SOLVED (2026-07-17, by disassembly)

The field-level probing (below) had mapped the *structure* of the seeding but
stalled on two pieces: the exact `(seed0, seed1)` combine, and how a taus88 stream
becomes the permutation tables. Both fell out immediately once the shipped
executable was disassembled - the macOS universal binary
(`.../Factorio.app/Contents/MacOS/factorio`, 2.1.11) is **not stripped**: it
retains mangled C++ symbols, so `NoiseOperations::BasisNoise`, `Noise::setSeed`
and `Noise::noise` are all findable by name and disassemblable directly.

### The whole algorithm

```
# From the BasisNoise ctor: how (seed0, seed1) become the two args to setSeed.
word    = max(seed0 + 7*(seed1 >> 8), 0x155)   # uint;  seed1 LOW byte is dropped here
lowByte = seed1 & 0xff                          # passed separately

# From Noise::setSeed(uint word, uchar lowByte): one continuous taus88 stream,
# seeded s1 = s2 = s3 = word, drives four backward Fisher-Yates (Durstenfeld)
# shuffles of identity[0..255], IN THIS ORDER:
scratch = shuffle(identity)     # draws   0..254
salt    = scratch[lowByte]      # a single byte, stored at this+5
yTable  = shuffle(identity)     # draws 255..509   (object offset +0x006)
xTable  = shuffle(identity)     # draws 510..764   (object offset +0x106)
gradPerm= shuffle(identity)     # draws 765..1019  (permutes the gradient table)

# From Noise::noise: the hash carries the salt as a constant XOR.
h(i, j) = xTable[i & 255] ^ yTable[j & 255] ^ salt
G       = gradientTable[ gradPerm[h] ]     # gradientTable is angle-ordered 4.2*(cos,sin)
```

`shuffle` is the textbook backward Durstenfeld: `for pos = 255..1: j = next() %
(pos+1); swap(t[pos], t[j])`. `next()` is one canonical L'Ecuyer taus88 step
(the game vectorizes it - z2/z3 in the two NEON lanes, z1 scalar - but the
sequence is identical to the scalar generator in `src/noise/spotCandidates.ts`).

Implementation: `basisNoiseTablesFromSeed` in `src/noise/basisNoise.ts`. It folds
the salt into `sigma` (`sigma[h] = gradPerm[h ^ salt]`) so the existing
`a[i]^b[j]` evaluator reproduces `gradPerm[xTable[i]^yTable[j]^salt]` unchanged.

### Why each earlier field-level observation falls out

- **`seed0` bit 0 is dead; `0..341` all collapse to one field; `342` is the
  first distinct one; `512==513`, `1024==1025`.** All from
  `word = max(seed0 + ..., 0x155)` seeding `s1=s2=s3=word`: the clamp guards the
  taus88 all-zero fixed point (0x155 = 341), and taus88's state words drop their
  low 1/3/4 bits on the first step, killing `seed0`'s bit 0.
- **`a`/`b` depend on `seed0` and `seed1>>8` only; the low byte is discarded.**
  Because the low byte does not enter `word`, and `a`/`b` are built purely from
  the `word`-seeded stream. The old `(0,256) ~ (0,0)` "coincidence" is real: both
  give `word <= 0x155` (clamped equal) with `lowByte = 0`.
- **`sigma` (hash -> direction) depends on the full `seed1`.** Because the low
  byte enters as `salt = scratch[lowByte]`, XORed into the hash at evaluation -
  a per-seed constant offset that makes the effective `hash -> direction` map move
  with the low byte while `a`/`b` stay put.

### How it was found in the binary (method notes)

1. `nm factorio | c++filt | grep BasisNoise` -> `NoiseOperations::BasisNoise::run`,
   the ctors taking `(uint seed0, uint seed1, ...)`, etc. `run` is a ~100-byte
   thunk that tail-calls `Noise::noise`; the seed math is in the `BasisNoise`
   ctor, which computes `setSeed(seed0 + 7*(seed1>>8), seed1 & 0xff)` and calls
   `Noise::setSeed`.
2. `objdump --macho` ignores `--start-address`/`--stop-address` and mis-maps
   vmaddr vs file offset - it dumped the whole 500 MB. A tiny capstone script
   (parse `LC_SEGMENT_64` for vmaddr->fileoff, disassemble a byte range,
   resolve `bl`/`b` targets against the `nm` table) is the workable disassembler.
3. `Noise::setSeed` is one clamp (`csel ... 0x155`) plus four Durstenfeld loops
   over one taus88 stream; the taus shift constants (`{13,19,12}/{2,25,4}/
   {3,11,17}`, masks `~1/~7/~15`) sit in `__const` and confirm canonical taus88.
   `Noise::Noise(bool)` builds the static template: `a[k]=k`, `b[k]=k` (identity),
   gradient slot `k` = a minimax-poly `(cos, sin)` at angle `2*pi*k/256`.
4. The one non-obvious bit is the **draw offset**: table `a` (the X table, at
   `this+0x106`) is the *third* shuffle, so it starts at draw 510, not 0 - the
   255-draw scratch pass and the Y table precede it. A gauge-robust GF(2) offset
   scan against the fixture pinned it at 510 (and revealed the fixture's "a" is
   the game's `this+0x106` X table, indexed by the x coordinate in `Noise::noise`).
5. Verified: generating `a`/`b`/`sigma` from the seed alone and evaluating
   reproduces the game to ~2e-7 across 9 `(seed0, seed1)` pairs exercising the
   `7*(seed1>>8)` combine (seed1 up to 65535), the nonzero-lowByte salt
   (low = 1..255), the `0x155` clamp (seed0 = 7), and `seed0 = 2^31`.

### The field-level structure work (superseded, kept for method)

Before the disassembly, the seeding was attacked purely through the field. That
work correctly established: the `0x155` clamp and `s1=s2=s3=word` seeding (shared
with `spot_noise`); that `basis` has no `SEED_BASE` (unlike spot); that there are
three seed-dependent permutations with `a`/`b` driven by `(seed0, seed1>>8)` and
`sigma` by the full `seed1`; and that `sigma` is **not** a fixed gradient table.
It could not crack the combine or the table generator by blind search - every
textbook shuffle off a taus88 stream failed the exact-integer-grid test, because
the real build burns 255 draws on the scratch pass first and salts the hash.
Lesson: for a generator that is one short function of machine code, a
**non-stripped binary is the fastest oracle by far** - hours of blind GF(2) /
shuffle search vs. one afternoon of disassembly.

The gauge-free tools built for that effort are still the right verification
harness:

**Raw direction-grid recovery.** With `input_scale = 1`, noise coord == world
coord. Near lattice point `(I,J)`, `value(I+eps, J) ~= C * cos(2*pi*K/256)` and
`value(I, J+eps) ~= C * sin(2*pi*K/256)`, so `K(I,J) =
round(atan2(vy,vx)/(2*pi)*256) mod 256` is the physical direction index. `eps =
1/256` is exact in f32 for `I,J <= 255` and isolates the `(I,J)` corner. This is
denser and stricter than the float field, and gauge-free.

**Which-seed GF(2) test** (`which_seed.py`). For each grid recover the
XOR-difference vectors `alpha(I) = L(a[I]^a[0])`, `beta(J) = L(b[J]^b[0])` via a
per-grid unscrambler; two grids share a table iff a single GF(2) 8x8 matrix maps
one grid's difference vectors to the other's. This is what proved `a`/`b` depend
on `seed1>>8` only, and (reused) what pinned the draw offset at 510.

### Reproducing the seeding oracle

Rebuild the headless probe in a scratch dir: a mod registering
`{ type = "noise-expression", name = "probe_elev", expression =
"basis_noise{x = x, y = y, seed0 = <S0>, seed1 = <S1>, input_scale = 0.125,
output_scale = 1}" }`, a `--map-gen-settings` JSON routing
`property_expression_names.elevation = "probe_elev"`, and an `on_init` that calls
`surface.calculate_tile_properties({"elevation"}, positions)` and
`helpers.write_file`s the result, then `error("DUMPED-OK")` to exit (~1.7 s/run).
An isolated `--config` INI with `read-data` at the app's `Contents/data` and
`write-data` in the scratch dir keeps it clear of the real install. The mod must
declare `"factorio_version": "2.1"`. Sample the *same* positions for every seed
and diff against `basisNoiseTablesFromSeed`.

## spot_noise - SOLVED (see spot-noise-NOTES.md)

`spot_noise` - which places every ore patch, long called "black magic" - was
cracked on 2026-07-17: taus88 candidate RNG + a dart-throw selection phase. Full
write-up in `docs/noise/spot-noise-NOTES.md`; implementations in
`src/noise/spotCandidates.ts` and `src/noise/spotSelection.ts`. The `0x155` clamp
and `s1=s2=s3=word` seeding proven there are what identified basis's `seed0` word,
and the shared taus88 is the same generator basis shuffles its tables with.

## Reproducing

The probe harness is not committed (it needs a Factorio install). Recipe: an
isolated `--config` INI with `read-data=__PATH__executable__/../data`, a mod
registering `{ type = "noise-expression", name = "probe", expression =
"basis_noise{x = x, y = y, seed0 = map_seed, seed1 = 0, input_scale = ..., output_scale = 1}" }`,
`--map-gen-settings` pointing `property_expression_names.elevation` at it, and an
`on_init` that calls `calculate_tile_properties` and `helpers.write_file`s the
result. See `docs/mapexchangestrings/maptype-elevation-NOTES.md` for the same
headless setup.
