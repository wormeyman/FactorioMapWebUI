# Client-side map preview - roadmap

Forward-looking plan (not a living doc - a point-in-time record, like the specs
under `docs/superpowers/`). Written 2026-07-17, right after `basis_noise` and
`spot_noise` were fully reverse-engineered.

## Goal

Generate Factorio 2.1.11 map previews **in the browser**, from a `Preset`, with no
server round-trip - to optionally replace (or front-run) the headless
`preview-service/` container with instant, offline previews.

Correctness bar: **visually faithful**, with per-expression agreement to ~1e-6
against the game (the fastapprox noise floor - bit-exactness is the wrong goal,
see `basis-noise-NOTES.md`). A preview is downsampled (~1 px per N tiles), so
small numeric drift is invisible anyway.

Non-goal: reproducing the game's threading, chunk streaming, or entity placement.
We evaluate noise per pixel, independently.

## Where we are: the hard part is done

The two primitives the community called "black magic" are solved and verified
against the game's own machine code:

- **`basis_noise`** - `src/noise/basisNoise.ts` (`basisNoise`, and
  `basisNoiseTablesFromSeed` for the full seed -> tables derivation).
  `docs/noise/basis-noise-NOTES.md`.
- **`spot_noise`** - candidate RNG `src/noise/spotCandidates.ts`, selection
  `src/noise/spotSelection.ts`, rendering documented.
  `docs/noise/spot-noise-NOTES.md`.

What remains is **breadth, not depth**: an expression evaluator, a handful of
smaller primitives, and a large body of game *data* (the expression trees + tile
autoplace) to port - all of it validatable against the oracle, none of it
research-hard.

## The stack

```
6. Render        tile/resource -> color, downsample, compose image
5. Tile types    elevation + climate -> winning tile (autoplace "peaks")
4. Settings      control:*:frequency/size/richness/bias, property_expression_names
3. Expressions   base-game trees: elevation, temperature, moisture, aux, resources
2. Evaluator     the 14 NoiseOperations + arithmetic + built-in vars (x,y,distance,seed)
1. Primitives    basis_noise (done), spot_noise (done), + the rest below
```

## Do this first: the validation harness (M0)

Everything below is built test-first against the game, exactly as the primitives
were. Commit the harness so every later layer has ground truth.

- [x] Commit a reusable headless oracle under `test/oracle/` (currently rebuilt
      ad hoc each session): a mod that routes an arbitrary named noise expression
      onto `elevation`, reads `calculate_tile_properties({"elevation"}, positions)`
      in `on_init`, `write_file`s JSON, `error("DUMPED-OK")` to exit (~1.7 s/run).
      Recipe in `basis-noise-NOTES.md` / `noise-oracle-basis-measurements`.
      It needs a local Factorio install, so gate the tests on its presence.
- [x] A `sampleExpression(exprString, positions, {seed, ...}) -> number[]` helper
      that runs the oracle and returns game values, for use as fixtures.
- [x] Decide fixture policy: capture once, commit JSON (like the existing
      `basis-noise*.json`), run the comparison in CI without Factorio.

## Milestone 1 - MVP: elevation land/water/coast

The smallest recognizable preview. Proves the evaluator design before the big
data port.

- [x] **Evaluator core** (`src/noise/eval/`): a per-pixel evaluator. Recommended
      shape - compile each named expression to a JS closure `(ctx) => number`
      where `ctx = { x, y, seed, controls }`; the expression tree maps directly to
      nested calls. (The game compiles to a register program in `NoiseCache`; we
      do **not** need to replicate that - it is an internal batching optimization.)
- [x] **Remaining primitives needed for elevation** (RE against the oracle):
  - `MultioctaveNoise` / `VariablePersistenceMultioctaveNoise` - octave layering
    over `basis_noise`. Already partly measured (basis summed, ~RMS-normalized,
    std ratio 1.077x at octaves=4). Nail persistence/lacunarity/per-octave seed
    and input-scale exactly. `NoiseOperations::MultioctaveNoise::run` at a known
    address (see the disassembler in `scratchpad`), or infer from
    `core/prototypes/noise-programs` Lua.
  - Trivial math ops: `Const`, `Clamp`, `If`, `PowInt`, arithmetic
    (`BinaryExpression` add/sub/mul/div/min/max, `UnaryExpression`). These are
    one-liners; confirm signatures from the binary if in doubt.
  - `DistanceFromNearestPoint` (starting-area / spawn shaping) if the elevation
    tree uses it.
- [x] **The elevation expression**: Nauvis `elevation` (the default) ported
      2026-07-19 as `makeElevationNauvis` (`src/noise/expressions/elevationNauvis.ts`,
      merged f95594f) - a 1:1 hand-port of `elevation_nauvis_function` from
      `core/prototypes/noise-programs.lua`, validated against the oracle to the f32
      floor (worst far-field 4.08e-3, near-spawn 2.87e-6). KEY finding: it needs NO
      new primitive - `ridge`/`terrace` (rated "small" below) are used by NO
      elevation tree (every apparent "ridge" was the `b`ridge`` substring). The
      Island variant (`elevation_island`, a trivial `bias=-1000` lakes variant)
      shipped 2026-07-19 as `makeElevationIsland` (`src/noise/expressions/elevationIsland.ts`)
      - a thin wrapper over `makeElevationLakes` with `bias=-1000` and
      `segmentation_multiplier/4`, validated against the oracle to the f32 floor
      (worst far-field 6.66e-3, near-spawn 5.2e-7). All three base map types
      (Nauvis, Lakes, Island) now render client-side; they dispatch via a `mapType` selector.
- [x] **Render**: `elevation < 0` -> water (deep vs shallow by threshold), else
      land; draw to a `<canvas>` at a chosen scale. Coastline falls out.
- [x] **Validate**: sample the game's `elevation` at a grid for a few seeds; diff
      to ~1e-6; then eyeball the rendered coastline against a real
      `--generate-map-preview`.

Done = a recognizable land/water/coastline image from a `Preset`, matching the
game's elevation to the noise floor.

## Milestone 2 - climate terrain colors - DONE 2026-07-19

Shipped on branch `feat/m2-climate-terrain` (see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-milestone2-climate-terrain-design.md` and
`docs/noise/terrain-render-NOTES.md`). Client renders Nauvis terrain colors that
match the real game's tile placement at 100% (153/153 oracle points, 3 seeds).

- [x] Ported `temperature_basic`, `moisture_nauvis`, `aux_nauvis` (default Nauvis
      climate) as hand-written closures over the solved primitives, reusing the
      extracted `nauvisShared` internals (`nauvis_plateaus`/`hills`/`bridge_billows`
      + new `forest_path_billows`). Oracle-validated to the f32 floor (temperature
      worst 7.07e-5, aux 1.01e-5, moisture 2.76e-5). `temperature` is ported but
      unused by tiles. KEY: `trees_forest_path_cutout` is billow noise, not tree
      placement.
- [x] **Reverse-engineered the native `expression_in_range`** (undocumented C++
      builtin) from the oracle: `min(peak_maximum, peak_multiplier * min_i(min(v_i -
      from_i, to_i - v_i)))` - per-dim triangular peak, min across dims, no lower
      clamp, `peak_maximum` may be Infinity (sand-1). Worst residual 9.5e-7. See
      `docs/noise/expression-in-range-NOTES.md`.
- [x] **Tile-type resolution** (`src/noise/tiles/`): the 21 Nauvis tiles as a
      catalog (`catalog.ts`) built on `expression_in_range_base`/`water_base`/
      `noise_layer_noise`; `resolveTile` picks the argmax `probability_expression`
      (tiles are a pure argmax - `order` has no effect). Tile selection is driven by
      aux + moisture (land) and elevation (water); temperature is unused.
- [x] Palette: each tile's `map_color`, cross-checked byte-for-byte against
      `tiles.lua`.
- [x] **Validated tile assignment against the game** via a new `get_tile` tile-ID
      oracle path (chunk-generate + `surface.get_tile().name`, `test/oracle/oracle.ts`),
      NOT `--generate-map-preview` (which only sanity-checks compositing). The
      widened multi-seed fixture (20/21 tiles) caught a latent `quickMultioctaveNoise`
      octave-seed bug (invisible on even seeds) - fixed to a flat `seed0 + k`.
- [x] Terrain render path (`renderTerrain`, water early-out with an analytically
      proven-safe threshold) + a Terrain/Elevation view toggle (Nauvis only). The
      moisture/aux sliders drive the terrain view (non-default climate is a faithful
      port but not oracle-validated point-by-point; only the default preset is).

Done = colored terrain (grass / sand / dirt / desert variants + water), matching the
game's tile placement at the default preset.

## Milestone 3 - resources

`spot_noise` is fully solved; this is wiring, not research.

**M3a (regular whole-map patches) - DONE** (merged to `main`, pushed, deployed live
2026-07-20).
Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-19-milestone3-resources-design.md`, plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-milestone3a-regular-patches.md`.

- [x] Port the per-resource autoplace expressions (iron/copper/coal/stone/
      uranium + crude-oil) from `prototypes/entity/resources.lua` +
      `resource-autoplace.lua`. `src/noise/resources/` = catalog (6 param sets),
      resourceMath (distance/amplitude local functions), regularPatches
      (`makeRegularPatches`: spot field + blob term). The `control:<resource>:*`
      levers flow in via `readResourceControls`.
- [x] Wire `selectSpots` + the max-of-cones renderer into per-pixel evaluation,
      region-cached. The one unknown (`random_penalty`'s batch composition inside
      spot-quantity selection) resolved: a batch over all skip-set accepted spots
      in acceptance order (`quantityBatch`). Oracle-validated (pure-regular fixture,
      iron+uranium, 2 seeds): abs error < 0.7 units everywhere after fixing the
      cube root to the game's fastapprox `pow` (`fastApprox.ts`, `fastCbrt`).
- [x] Overlay resource patches on the terrain image (resource `map_color`),
      order-priority winner where `probability >= 0.5` (`resolveResource` +
      `renderResources`); worker `view:"resources"`; Resources toggle on the panel.
- [x] Validated against the pure-regular `calculate_tile_properties` oracle and a
      headless full-view render (all 6 ore types as blob patches, spawn cleared).

- [x] **Ore excluded from water** (2026-07-20): resources collide with water, so
      renderResources skips any pixel the terrain drew as deepwater/water. Reuses
      renderTerrain's exact water decision (no re-derivation), so the ore edge lines
      up with the drawn coastline.

**M3b (starting patches, near-spawn guaranteed ore) - DONE** (merged to `main`,
pushed, deployed live 2026-07-20; branch `feat/m3-resources` fast-forwarded in,
tip `0131aa8`). Plan
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-milestone3b-starting-patches.md`.

- [x] Ported `starting_patches` (`src/noise/resources/startingPatches.ts`) for the
      four solids (iron/copper/coal/stone): a spot field (region_size 450,
      candidate_spot_count 32, spacing 48, `hard_region_target_quantity`) plus the
      same `blobs0` blob term shape as regular patches, over a deterministic
      favorability (lake-mask x modulation x origin-excluder x 2, minus a distance
      term - no random jitter). `resourcePatches.ts` composes
      `all_patches = max(starting, regular)` for the four solids; oil/uranium
      (no starting placement) delegate to the regular field unchanged.
- [x] **Version-discrepancy finding**: the `~/Downloads/factorio 4/data` dump used
      to draft the M3b plan is Factorio 2.0.77 (stale); the app targets 2.1.11.
      `starting_patches` changed materially between those versions (radius
      120->150, region_size radius*2->radius*3, spacing 32->48, and the
      favorability term dropped its `random_penalty_at(0.5,1)` jitter entirely in
      favor of a deterministic `origin_excluder`). Caught mid-implementation by
      diffing against the oracle and the Steam app's own bundled 2.1.11 Lua - see
      `docs/noise/M3-session-handoff.md` and the
      `factorio-data-version-hazard` memory note for the full finding and the
      authoritative source path.
- [x] The starting favorability's lake mask couples to the map's `elevation`
      PROPERTY, which on the default Nauvis map is `elevation_nauvis` (confirmed
      against the oracle, not the `elevation_lakes` literal an earlier draft
      assumed). `makeStartingPatches` hardcodes `makeElevationNauvis`; generalizing
      to Lakes/Island starting elevation is deferred until the resolver needs a
      non-default map type for resources.
- [x] `selectSpots` gained a `favorabilityBatch` option (mirrors the existing
      `quantityBatch`) for favorability expressions with a `random_penalty` batch
      term - unused by 2.1.11 starting patches (whose favorability turned out
      deterministic) but available for future primitives - plus routed the
      hard-target `coneScale` shrink through `fastCbrt` (was `Math.cbrt`).
- [x] Oracle-validated against a `has_starting_area_placement=1` fixture: near-spawn
      points match to well under 1.0 absolute. `test/resourcePatches.spec.ts` uses a
      combined `abs<1.0 OR rel<1e-2` tolerance to also accommodate the pre-existing
      far-field `basisNoise` f32 floor (~5e-4 relative on ~1e4-magnitude points)
      without masking real near-spawn errors.
- [x] Headless full-view eyeball (Task 7): iron/copper/coal/stone patches cluster
      tightly around spawn, oil renders as a small dot far out (no starting
      placement, as expected), spawn is not bare.

**M3.5 (per-tile placement stipple) - SPIKED then DEFERRED (2026-07-20).** The
placement RNG was reverse-engineered (`EntityMapGenerationTask::generateEntities` /
`generateEntityOnTile`): it is taus88, seeded once per 32x32 chunk from
`ChunkPosition` (`max(341, 0x3FBE2C + 7919*chunkX + 7907*chunkY)`, no map-seed), and
the roll is `place if taus88()/2^32 < probability`. But it is a **single per-chunk
stream shared across ALL entity autoplacers** (enemies, rocks, resources), consumed
in a fixed order with 2 data-dependent jitter draws per placed entity - so faithful
resource stipple would require simulating whole-chunk entity generation across
subsystems this app never ported. Multi-session + cross-subsystem; **deferred**
(Eric, 2026-07-20). Full RE + a cheaper cosmetic-dither alternative:
`docs/noise/placement-roll-NOTES.md`. Solid-footprint (opaque where `prob >= 0.5`)
ships in M3a/b and stands as the M3 end state.

M3a follow-ups (known, deferred by priority - 2026-07-20):

- [ ] **Ore excluded from cliffs** (low priority, deferred): resources also collide
      with cliffs in-game. Cliffs now render (M4, `view: "cliffs"`), but this
      exclusion is still not wired into `renderResources` - it would reuse the same
      `WATER_TILE_COLORS`-style pixel-exclusion mechanism, gated on the M4 cliff
      placement (which is itself only ~94% exact pending the deferred
      `fixImpossibleCells`, see the M4 section below).
- [ ] **Oil renders as tiny dots, not patches** (low priority, partly by-design):
      crude-oil is genuinely sparse in-game (`random_probability = 1/48`,
      `spot_size 1..1`), so it is individual wells, not a contiguous field - the
      `>= 0.5` solid footprint just makes each spot ~1 tile. Two sub-items if we
      ever want it to read as a patch: (a) our `regularPatches.probability()` does
      NOT yet apply oil's probability factor from the spec; (b) a faithful oil look
      needs the M3.5 per-tile placement stipple.
      - **2026-07-20 finding (from `~/GitHub/factorio-data` @ 2.1.11,
        `resource-autoplace.lua:103-105`):** for `random_probability < 1` the game
        appends `* random_penalty{x=x, y=y, source=1, amplitude=1/random_probability}`
        to the probability expression (and `/ random_probability` to richness - the
        richness half is ALREADY done in `regularPatches.ts`). The `random_penalty`
        factor is `1 - (1/rp)*U`, i.e. it is itself a per-tile ~`rp` Bernoulli baked
        into the probability. **Applying (a) alone, with the current `>= 0.5`
        threshold render, makes oil sparser or vanish** (the factor is `>= 0.5` for
        only ~`rp/2` of tiles, and oil's spots are already ~1 tile), so it is NOT a
        standalone visual win - it only pays off combined with M3.5's roll (place if
        roll < probability). So (a) is really M3.5-prep, or wants a per-resource
        render rule (e.g. render oil where probability `> 0`, ~`rp` density, using
        only the already-validated `randomPenalty` primitive - a cheap approximation
        that skips the un-RE'd placement RNG). **Decision (2026-07-20, Eric):
        FOLD INTO M3.5** - apply the probability factor together with the RE'd
        placement roll (place if roll < probability), validated tile-for-tile
        against `find_entities`. Oil stays as-is (tiny dots) until M3.5; no
        standalone change.

Done = ore patches overlaid on land, responding to the frequency/size/richness sliders.

## Milestone 4 - the long tail

- [x] Cliffs (`cliffiness` / cliff elevation bands) - DONE (2026-07-20; merged to
      main + deployed live, main tip `e783901`). Done = a Nauvis-gated
      `view: "cliffs"` footprint overlay painting `CLIFF_MAP_COLOR = [144,119,87]`
      (a 5x5 block per cell for preview legibility), driven by the two oracle-validated
      noise fields (`cliff_elevation_nauvis`, `cliffiness_nauvis`) plus a
      disasm-derived geometric placement rule (`crossesCliff` + the 4-tile grid +
      `toMaybeCliffOrientation` none/not-none predicate), levers wired
      (`nauvis_cliff` frequency/continuity + `cliffSettings`). Validated ~94% against
      real `find_entities_filtered{type="cliff"}` dumps (frac 0.943 seed 123456,
      0.942 seed 777771) and cross-checked against a real
      `factorio --generate-map-preview` render of the same seed/region (95.7%
      spatial agreement at render resolution, using the game's own emitted
      `[144,119,87]` pixels as ground truth). Full writeup: `cliffs-NOTES.md`.
      **Still deferred** (do not treat as done): `fixImpossibleCells` (the ~6%
      residual - border-crossing zeroing + impossible-cell rewriting), the exact
      `wouldCollide` collision rejection (approximated by the existing
      water-pixel exclusion), and the ore-on-cliff exclusion this unblocks (see the
      M3a follow-up above). `VoronoiNoise` (layer-1 primitive table below) is
      confirmed **unneeded for Nauvis** - it appears nowhere in the cliff tree or
      any other Nauvis expression traced so far, only on Space-Age planets - so it
      remains un-ported with no open TODO against it.
- [x] Enemy bases (enemy autoplace - `enemy-autoplace-utils.lua`), starting-area
      clearing. Done = footprint overlay (`view: "enemies"`) from the
      oracle-validated `enemy_base_probability` field, threshold
      `ENEMY_FOOTPRINT_THRESHOLD = 0.05`, spawners only (worms and per-nest
      placement deferred, see `docs/noise/enemy-bases-NOTES.md`).
- [x] Trees (tree autoplace - `base/prototypes/entity/trees.lua`), decoratives
      ruled out. Done = a density-shaded `view: "trees"` overlay, all 15 Nauvis
      species (`tree_01` ... `tree_09_red`), oracle-validated to the ~1e-3 noise
      floor, composited into `view: "all"` between terrain and the resource/
      enemy/cliff overlays, with `control:trees` frequency/size wired. The
      preview's own binary was disassembled first: it places real entities and
      charts them (`chartEntities` -> `Chart::drawEntity` ->
      `ChartingInterface::drawRectangle`), so this port renders the exact
      expected value of what the game's per-tile placement roll would produce
      rather than a guessed shading. The charted footprint (1.0x1.0 tiles,
      kernel `[0.5,1,0.5]`, compounding per-tree alpha) was determined
      empirically against a real game render and validated on two seeds
      (game ink / our ink: 5.70/4.67 = 1.22x @ seed 123456, 7.89/6.89 = 1.14x
      @ seed 777771) - the residual is the expected-value-vs-discrete gap and
      needs the deferred Phase 2 stipple to close, not further tuning.
      **Decoratives are ruled out by binary evidence**: no
      `DecorativeMapGenerationTask` symbol exists anywhere in the shipped
      binary, and the preview worker calls only `chartCliffs` + `chartEntities`
      - the game's own preview shows no decoratives either. Full writeup,
      including the oracle-caught per-species `sizeOffset` bug and its
      methodology lesson, the `BASIS_ABS_MAX` early-out measurement, and the
      measured render cost: `docs/noise/trees-NOTES.md`. Design record:
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-21-nauvis-trees-design.md`. **Still
      deferred** (do not treat as done): the per-tile placement roll (Phase 2,
      `docs/noise/placement-roll-NOTES.md`), worms/fish autoplacers, and
      cliff exclusion (consistent with the existing ore-on-cliffs gap).
- [~] Non-Nauvis planets (Space Age) - each is another expression set.
      **Vulcanus TERRAIN done 2026-07-23** (V1: spawn geometry, cracks, the radial
      ashlands/mountains/basalts biome system, volcano spots, climate aux/moisture/
      temperature, elevation, the ~24 `*_range` tile-probability expressions + the
      19-tile argmax, and planet-dispatched rendering). Every expression is
      oracle-validated against real Factorio 2.1.12 (Space Age) to the f32 floor;
      tile selection hits **96.85% `get_tile` agreement** (369/381) - the residual is
      the deliberate resource-term approximation plus f32 boundary flips, not a
      transcription error. Spec/plan:
      `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-23-vulcanus-client-preview-design.md`,
      `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-23-vulcanus-client-preview-v1.md`; per-expression
      notes in `docs/noise/vulcanus-*-NOTES.md`.
      **Two known gaps, both deliberate:**
      - **Perf.** Vulcanus is ~60x heavier per pixel than Nauvis terrain (~545 us/px
        vs ~9 us/px; 1024^2 is ~9.5 min single-thread, tens of seconds even tiled).
        It renders correctly but is NOT yet interactive. Prime suspect is the
        per-pixel volcano `spot_noise`/region work re-running without memoization -
        likely optimizable the way the Nauvis tiling analysis went, not a hard limit.
        **Do this before adding more Vulcanus overlays.**
      - **Resource coupling.** A few tile `*_range` expressions reference V2 resource
        expressions (`vulcanus_calcite_region`, `vulcanus_sulfuric_acid_region_patchy`,
        `vulcanus_metal_tile`); these are approximated at their no-resource default, so
        tiles are faithful everywhere EXCEPT inside resource-patch cells.
      Deferred: V2 Vulcanus resources, V3 cliffs, demolishers (the only `voronoi_cell_id`
      user - skipping it is why Vulcanus needed no `VoronoiNoise` port). Fulgora/Aquilo
      DO build terrain on Voronoi, so they will force that primitive.

## Milestone 5 - integration

- [ ] A `previewMap(preset, {width, height, scale}) -> ImageData` entry point.
- [x] Wire into the app UI next to / instead of the `preview-service` call. Keep
      the server path as a fallback and as a cross-check oracle.
- [x] Perf: evaluate off the main thread (Web Worker); tile the viewport. **Done
      2026-07-21** - the 1024x1024 preview is split into 64 128px tiles rendered
      across a pool of `hardwareConcurrency - 1` workers and blitted
      progressively. Browser-measured on a 12-core machine (8 performance + 4
      efficiency), seed 123456, median of 3:

      | view      | single worker | tiled (11 workers) | speedup |
      | --------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
      | elevation | ~1,700 ms     | 237 ms             | 7.2x    |
      | terrain   | ~9,100 ms     | 1,519 ms           | 6.0x    |

      Half the image is on screen about a second before the render finishes, so
      the perceived latency is lower again. Tiling is byte-identical to the
      single render - `test/tiledEquality.spec.ts` asserts it across all six
      views, and the only renderer needing a seam fix was cliffs (marks are
      painted around a cell centre, so each tile queries a 2-tile halo clamped
      to the image).

      Caching per-region spot lists across tiles was measured and **rejected**:
      rebuilding every resolver per tile costs only 1.03-1.07x total CPU, so the
      scene/geometry split it would have required was not worth it. See
      `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-21-region-tiling-renderer.md`.

      manual Generate).

## Remaining primitives to reverse-engineer (layer 1)

The binary defines exactly **14** `NoiseOperations::*::run` types. Status:

| op | needed for | difficulty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BasisNoise` | everything | DONE |
| `SpotNoise` | resources/enemies | DONE (RNG+select+render) |
| `Const`, `Clamp`, `If`, `PowInt` | all trees | trivial (math) |
| `BinaryExpression`/`UnaryExpression` (arithmetic) | all trees | trivial |
| `MultioctaveNoise` | terrain | DONE (`multioctaveNoise.ts`) |
| `QuickMultioctaveNoise` | climate (temp/moisture/aux) | DONE (`quickMultioctaveNoise.ts`) |
| `VariablePersistenceMultioctaveNoise` | terrain (elevation) | DONE (`variablePersistenceMultioctaveNoise.ts`) |
| `DistanceFromNearestPoint` | spawn/starting area | DONE (`distanceFromNearestPoint.ts`) - `min(maximum_distance, nearest euclidean dist to any point)`; points int/256 fixed-point. Geometry read off disasm; needs runtime point data (see below) so validates via the elevation tree, not standalone. |
| `Terrace` | terrain banding | small - NOT used by any elevation tree (2026-07-19) |
| `Ridge` | terrain | small - NOT used by any elevation tree; every "ridge" in noise-programs.lua is the `b`ridge`` substring (2026-07-19) |
| `RandomPenalty` | jitter | small |
| `Multisampling` | AA/quality | small |
| `VoronoiNoise` | some terrains | **confirmed unneeded for Nauvis** (2026-07-20, M4 cliffs RE) - present in the binary but not referenced by the cliff tree or any other Nauvis expression traced so far; only appears on Space-Age planets. Un-ported, no open TODO. |

Method for each: disassemble `NoiseOperations::<Op>::run` (the capstone
disassembler `scratchpad/re/fdis.py` seeks by symbol address from
`nm | c++filt`), and/or probe it through the oracle, then validate to ~1e-6.
None are "black magic" - the two that were are already done.

### M1 scoping note: the elevation tree depends on runtime spawn data

Traced the Nauvis `elevation` tree (`core/prototypes/noise-programs.lua`). The
default `elevation_nauvis` is large (`elevation_nauvis_function` over `nauvis_main`,
`nauvis_bridges`, `nauvis_detail`, `nauvis_macro`, `nauvis_hills_plateaus`, ...);
the `elevation_lakes` / `elevation_island` variants are smaller
(`finish_elevation{make_0_12like_lakes{...}}`). **All of them reference values that
are not pure noise:**

- `distance` - distance from the spawn point (world origin-ish).
- `starting_lake_positions` / `starting_positions` - runtime-generated spawn/lake
  points, fed to `distance_from_nearest_point`. These come from the game's
  starting-area placement, not a noise expression.
- `water_level`, `segmentation_multiplier` - map-gen settings (scalars the app's
  `Preset` already models, but the noise DSL exposes them as vars).

So an elevation render needs a decision before the evaluator work: either (a) render
**far from spawn**, where the `distance`- and `starting_*`-gated terms fade out, and
supply `water_level`/`segmentation_multiplier` from the preset - the cheapest path to
a recognizable coastline; or (b) additionally RE the spawn / starting-lake placement
to be faithful near the origin. (a) is the right MVP.

There is also an evaluator-shape fork: hand-port each named expression to a TS
closure (roadmap's stated primary strategy) vs. write a parser for the noise DSL
strings. Hand-porting is less upfront work for the MVP; a parser pays off only if
the whole tree corpus gets ported.

## Porting the expression trees (layer 3) - the biggest chunk

Two strategies; use both:

1. **Transpile the Lua** (primary). The base-game expressions live in
   `data/base/prototypes/**` and `data/core/prototypes/**` as the noise DSL (an
   expression-builder API). Re-express each named expression as a JS closure over
   the primitives. Some are generated by helper functions (autoplace utils) - port
   the helper, not each output.
2. **Capture + validate** (safety net). The game can serialize named noise
   expressions; and `calculate_tile_properties` gives exact values. Every ported
   expression is diffed against the game before it is trusted. This is what makes
   the port low-risk despite its size.

This layer is where the real effort and the ongoing maintenance sit: the trees
are large, interdependent, reference the `control:*` constants, and differ across
game versions and base-vs-Space-Age.

## Settings wiring (layer 4)

The app already models the levers in `Preset`
(`autoplaceControls`, `property_expression_names`, seed). The evaluator's `ctx`
needs to expose them as the `control:<name>:frequency|size|richness|bias`
constants and honor `property_expression_names` overrides (which can *replace* a
named expression entirely - e.g. the map-type elevation swap). `seed` = `seed0`
(random -> wire 0); each `basis_noise`/`spot_noise` call carries its own `seed1`.

## Risks and the build-vs-keep decision

- **Maintenance surface.** The expression trees track game versions and base vs
  Space Age. The `preview-service` container gets this for free by running the
  real game; a client port must be re-synced on updates.
- **You already have a working preview.** `preview-service/` (headless Factorio +
  Cloudflare) renders correct previews today. A client-side reimplementation is a
  **UX/infra optimization** (instant, offline, no cold starts), not a correctness
  need. Weigh the ongoing port cost against that benefit before committing past
  the MVP.
- **De-risking:** the MVP (M1) is cheap and proves the evaluator; stop there if
  the value/cost tradeoff does not hold up. The oracle makes every step verifiable,
  so there are no unknown cliffs left after the primitives.

## Suggested module layout

```
src/noise/
  basisNoise.ts          # done
  spotCandidates.ts      # done
  spotSelection.ts       # done
  eval/                  # M1: evaluator + primitive library + arithmetic
  expressions/           # M1+: ported base-game trees (elevation, climate, ...)
  tiles/                 # M2: tile autoplace peak resolution + palette
  preview/               # M1+: per-pixel driver, region spot cache, render to canvas
test/oracle/             # M0: committed headless harness + capture helper
```

## Immediate next action

Start **M0 + M1**: commit the oracle harness, build the evaluator core, RE
`MultioctaveNoise`, port Nauvis `elevation`, render land/water. That converts the
two solved primitives into an actual image and locks the evaluator design before
the large expression port begins.
