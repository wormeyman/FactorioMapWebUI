# random_penalty - reverse-engineering notes

Source: Factorio 2.1.11 (build 86962). Solved 2026-07-19 by disassembling the
non-stripped shipped executable (`NoiseOperations::RandomPenalty::run`,
`RandomPenalty.cpp`) and confirming against the headless oracle. Companion to
`basis-noise-NOTES.md` and `spot-noise-NOTES.md`; `random_penalty` is the same RNG
family (canonical L'Ecuyer taus88, base `0x3FBE2C`, primes 7919/7907, the 341
clamp).

Implementation: `src/noise/randomPenalty.ts`. Fixture:
`test/fixtures/oracle-random-penalty.seed123456.json`. Spec: `test/randomPenalty.spec.ts`.

## The primitive

`random_penalty{x, y, seed, source, amplitude}` subtracts a per-draw uniform
penalty from `source`:

```
output = source - amplitude * U          # U = taus88_output / 2^32,  U in [0,1)
```

Wrappers (`core/prototypes/noise-functions.lua`):

- `random_penalty_at(v, seed)` = `random_penalty{source = v, amplitude = v}`
- `random_penalty_between(from, to, seed)` = `random_penalty{source = to, amplitude = to - from}`
  (so the result lies in `[from, to]`)
- `random_penalty_inverse(seed, penalty)` = `random_penalty{source = 1, amplitude = 1/penalty}`
- `1 - random_penalty{... source = 1 ...}` appears directly too.

## It is a BATCH op (the important, non-obvious part)

`run(NoiseCache&)` evaluates a whole batch of query positions at once, and the RNG
state is **not** re-derived per tile:

1. **Seeded once, from the FIRST position in the batch:**

   ```
   word = max(341, 0x3FBE2C + 7919 * trunc(x0) + 7907 * trunc(y0 + seed))     (u32)
   ```

   - `x0, y0` are the coordinates of `positions[0]` only.
   - `trunc` is `fcvtzs` (truncate toward zero). `seed` (a constant) is folded into
     `y` (`y0 + seed`) *before* truncation.
   - **No `map_seed` dependence** - unlike `basis_noise`/`spot_noise`, there is no
     `seed0` XOR. Confirmed: varying the map seed leaves the values unchanged.
   - taus88 state `s1 = s2 = s3 = word` (the shared `src/noise/taus88.ts`).

2. **Streamed across the batch, LAST element to FIRST.** The op's loop index counts
   down, so `positions[N-1]` gets taus draw 0 and `positions[0]` gets the last draw.

3. **`source <= 0` passes through and consumes NO draw** (the documented "source
   must be > 0"). The tile outputs its `source` unchanged and the stream does not
   advance for it.

Because of (1) and (2), the value at a given `(x, y)` depends on the entire batch
and its order. A bare `calculate_tile_properties` probe of `random_penalty` is
therefore **not** a faithful per-tile oracle in isolation (same lesson as M2's
`get_tile` vs `calculate_tile_properties`): the oracle returns whatever the batch
produced, seeded from the batch's first point. The RE'd model reproduces measured
oracle batches exactly (3 batches + 2 singletons, plus the committed 5-config
fixture, to the f32 floor).

## The disassembly

```
lldb -b -o "disassemble --name '_ZNK15NoiseOperations13RandomPenalty3runER10NoiseCache'" "$FACTORIO_BIN"
```

lldb disassembles by mangled symbol name and annotates source lines - the fastest
oracle here (objdump's `--start-address/--stop-address` are broken on this Mach-O,
as noted in `noise-oracle-basis-measurements`). Key instructions:

- `w24 = 0x3FBE2C`; `madd w9, x_int, #7919, w24`; `mul w10, y_int, #7907`;
  `add w9, w10, w9` - the word, primes matching spot_noise.
- `fadd s0, y, ucvtf(seed_const)` before `fcvtzs` - `seed` folded into `y`.
- `cmp w9, #0x155; csel w9, w9, #341, hi` - unsigned clamp to >= 341.
- `dup.2s v0, w9` + scalar `w9` - taus88 state seeded to the word (2 lanes + scalar).
- loop: `fcmp source, #0.0; b.ls skip` (source<=0 guard); taus88 update (the
  `eor/ushl/bfxil` block, params 13/19/12, 2/25/4, 3/11/17 - canonical taus88);
  `ucvtf` the u32 draw, `* -2^-32` (`mov x12, #-0x4210000000000000`), `* amplitude`
  (`[x19,#0x1c]`), `+ source`.
- Op register/constant layout: out `+0x8`, x `+0xc`, y `+0x10`, source `+0x14`,
  seed const `+0x18`, amplitude const `+0x1c` (matches `ComplexExpression<...,3,2,0>`:
  3 register inputs + 2 constants).

## Composition inside spot selection - RESOLVED (2026-07-19, M3a Task 4)

How the game batches `random_penalty` inside the spot expressions is now pinned
against the pure-regular oracle (`test/fixtures/oracle-resource-regular...`). For
`regular_spot_quantity_expression = random_penalty_between(0.25, 2, 1) * quantityBase`:

- The batch = **all skip-set accepted spots** of the region, in **acceptance order**
  (the order `generatePoints` produced them), evaluated as ONE `random_penalty`
  batch BEFORE the favorability sort/trim (matches the spot-noise NOTES order of
  operations: generatePoints -> skip set -> evaluate expressions -> sort -> place).
- So per `RandomPenalty::run`: the stream is seeded from the FIRST accepted spot and
  consumed last-spot-first across that batch. Each spot's `U` therefore depends on
  the whole spot list, NOT on the spot's own position (the "singleton per spot"
  guess was close - uranium cones ~2% off - but wrong; the batch form is right).

Implemented via a new `quantityBatch` option on `selectSpots`
(`src/noise/spotSelection.ts`) that evaluates the spot quantities over the skip set
at once; `src/noise/resources/regularPatches.ts` supplies it with
`randomPenaltyBatch(spots, ...)`. This dropped the oracle error from **3e-1 to
~2e-3**.

### The ~1e-3 residual - RESOLVED (2026-07-20): it was fastapprox `cbrt`, not the trim boundary

The residual that the batch fix left (worst ~4.8e-2 relative, ~3 units absolute) was
**not** an f32 instability at the trim boundary (no spot is kept/dropped differently).
It was a single, smooth mechanism found by instrumentation:

1. Decomposed each field value into `spotField + blobTerm`. Points that sit *exactly*
   on the basement constant (outside every cone - `spotField == basement`) still
   carried ~0.35-unit error, so the error there is entirely in the **blob term**, not
   the cone/trim path.
2. Ruled out `basement` (f32 == f64 to 9e-4) and `basisNoise` (f32-stable) as sources.
3. Isolated it to the `cbrt` in `regular_spot_height_typical` (which drives
   `regular_blob_amplitude`). The game's noise machine takes that cube root through its
   **fastapprox `pow`** (Paul Mineiro `fastlog2`/`fastpow2`, the same pair
   `multioctave_noise`'s normalisation uses), not an exact `cbrt`. Exact `Math.cbrt`
   is ~7e-5 relative high, and it multiplies a large blob-amplitude scalar (~1800), so
   it shows up as ~0.3-0.7 units on blob values of thousands.

The same fastapprox `cbrt` + f32 arithmetic applies to the **cone render** (a
`spot_noise` op, evaluated per tile in the f32 machine): `radius = min(32, rq *
fastCbrt(quantity))`, `peak = 3q/(pi r^2)`, `cone = peak - sqrt(d2)*(peak/radius)` -
all f32.

Fix (2026-07-20): extracted the fastapprox primitives to `src/noise/fastApprox.ts`
(added `fastCbrt`); routed `regularSpotHeightTypicalAt` / `startingBlobAmplitude`
(resourceMath.ts) and the cone radius/peak/slope + spot quantity (regularPatches.ts)
through it in f32. Result across the pure-regular oracle (iron + uranium, 2 seeds,
4105 pts each): **absolute error < 0.7 units everywhere**, relative < 1e-3 across
patch interiors, up to ~9e-3 only at cone-edge / basement zero-crossings (the same f32
floor M1 elevation_lakes = 7.4e-3 and Island = 6.66e-3 documented). `test/regularPatches.spec.ts`
is now **un-skipped**, asserting `worstAbs < 1.0 && worstRel < 1e-2`.
